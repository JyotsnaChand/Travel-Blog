                    <p>The Maldives is a nation of islands in the Indian Ocean, that spans across the equator. The
                        country is
                        comprised of 1192 islands that stretch along a length of 871 kilometers. While the country
                        covers an area of
                        approximately 90,000 square kilometers, only 298 square kilometers of that is dry land. The
                        islands are
                        grouped into a double chain of 26 atolls.
                        The country’s unique geography mesmerizes the visitor. Reefs that offer bands of color, tiny
                        jewel-like
                        islands rimmed with the whitest of soft sand surrounded by the clearest shallow waters that one
                        can imagine.
                        Only 200 of the islands are inhabited, and a select few on each of the atolls are resorts and
                        some of the
                        islands are used for industry and agriculture.
                        The beauty of the Maldives is not only above the water. The Maldives is home to about five
                        percent of the
                        planet’s reefs that comes with an explosion of color contributed by soft and hard corals that
                        form them. The
                        reefs are home to a thousand species of fish. Lured by the rich nutrients that flow in with the
                        currents,
                        large pelagic fishes such as manta rays and whale sharks also make the Maldives their
                        home.Speedboat
                        transfer is the norm to resorts close to the International Airport. The rest is covered by
                        seaplane or
                        domestic flight. If you are travelling to Male you can take a taxi from the airport. Several
                        daily flights
                        operate from Velana International Airport to the 12 domestic and international airports in the
                        country.
                        Scheduled ferries also operate from Male to many of the atolls.</p>

                    <p>
                        Part of me is optimistic about the state of the Golden Temple. Not to be overly revisionist or reductionist
            in my opinion on the place, I like to remind myself that politics, ideology, and the like have always been
            at work in the world of the Harimandir Sahib. Problems apparent now are probably just a trade-off for
            problems of the past. But there is one thing that I cannot shake: the brash lack of care for our material
            heritage as seen in the conservation or otherwise of the buildings and art in and around Darbar Sahib.
            Living as I do within the holy city precincts the folks at Kashi House, who are behind the incredible book
            The Golden Temple of Amritsar: Reflections of the Past (1808-1959), asked me to assist in a ‘then & now’
            project. I was to take a few photos from the same angle and framing as a handful of iconic pictures from the
            book that date between 1850 and 1900, the dawn of the photographic age. I was happy to oblige but little did
            I realize just how memorable and thought-provoking the experience would be.

            My friend, Hari Mitar Singh, and I set out first to capture the towering structure of Baba Atal Rai from
            across the Kaulsar sarovar. A seven story octagonal structure topped with a minaret, the area around it is
            peaceful in comparison to the bustle around the shrine itself next door. Armed with the vintage image by way
            of comparison, the changes are fairly obvious: entire buildings are gone; new ones exist; different
            arrangements of trees. But the biggest changes can’t be seen from this angle; they lie on the inner and
            outer walls of the building.

                        Himachal Pradesh is a beautiful part of the Indian Himalayas encompassing wide valleys with snow-capped
            mountains, limpid lakes, rivers with gushing streams. Himachal Pradesh is formed by integrating 31 big and
            small princely hilly states to form a single full-fledged state after India got freedom in 1947. It became
            the 18th state of the Indian Union on April 15, 1948. It also got the status of Union Territory in 1956, but
            after the inclusion of some more hill areas from Punjab it again got the status of whole state, which is
            still continues in present as well. Himachal Pradesh in present time is one of the most important tourist
            destinations in India. There are various reasons of being as one of the most popular tourist destinations in
            India, but the most prominent are that, it welcomes the trekker from all over the world, spiritual tours,
            snow sports, etc. Himachal Pradesh also referred as the Devbhumi which literally means “Land of God” which
            is due to various temples and monasteries in the state. Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and it is
            covered with immense natural beauty, lofty ranges, deep valleys, swaying waterfall and lush greenery. One
            can easily reach here with roads, flights, and trains as the state has very good connectivity from other
            states and cities of India. Climate here changes dramatically from one place to other. The state is in high
            altitude Himalayan region and hence snowfall is a common sight in most parts of the state.
